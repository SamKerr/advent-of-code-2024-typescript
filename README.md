### Summary

The main goal of this repo is to have fun, explore typescript and solve some tricky problems.

I enjoy advent of code because the problems span a wide set of topics and can often be challenging to to crack. 

Examples of the problems I had to solve:
- Finding the largest fully-connected subgraph in a graph (efficiently)
- Finding the number of ways you can construct a word from a set of tokens (efficiently)
- Simulating a robot pushing boxes around a crowded warehouse
- Maze solving with variant rules, like wall-hoping 
- Simulating a CPU executing an assembly program and then reverse engineering the program to find which inputs give special outputs
- Simulating a chaotic process that produces an evolving binary image on each iteration, then finding at what point in the process a-somewhat precise picture of a christmas tree will first appear 
- Simulating an electronic circuit then debugging it to re-wire it
